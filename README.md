Array Problem
================
1) Find one missing number from array.
  - First solution is having a sorted array and we are able to find the missing value in O(N) time.
  - Second solution is having a sorted array and we are able to find the missing value in O(log N) time. This is the fastest approach.
  -Third solution is having unsorted array and we are able to find the solution getting the sum of all numbers using Gauss formula(n*(n+1)/2) and then iterating through the complete list to finf the missing number (Time complexity O(N))
